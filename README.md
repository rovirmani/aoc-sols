```bash
# Compile and run
cd 2024/day01
gcc solution.c -o solution
./solution
```

## About
These are my personal solutions to the Advent of Code challenges. Each solution includes:
- Solution code file (C for the first few days will do different languages for the later challenges)
- Input data file
- Brief explanation of the problem (in the solution file) (only sometimes when its somewhat hard) 
- Both parts of the daily challenge
